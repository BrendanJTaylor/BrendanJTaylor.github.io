    <h1>About</h1>
    
    <p>My name is Brendan Taylor and I am a student-athlete on the Track and Cross-Country team at the University of Oklahoma.</p>
    <p>I will be graduating May of 2019 with degrees in Finance and Management Information Systems (MIS).</p>
    <p>I am currently still looking for a full time position in a Finance or database entry role. I believe the skills I have learned in the class room and on a team will help me succeed at whatever role I earn.</p>
